## Pokepet
Poke-Pet is a React app, built so that users can create their own customized Pokemon card using their pet. After the user is satisfied, they are able to click download, and have their card saved to their computer or cellular device.

This project was created with Create-React-App, and styled with Styled-Components. The state is managed with the Context API which helped make the project a lot smoother because of the multiple sections of inputs within the app's form.
